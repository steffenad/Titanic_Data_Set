# Titanic

Exploring the Titantic Data Set with Python  

Repeating basic data exploration and machine learning tools in Python with the famous Titanic Data Set from "Kaggle".

Task: Binary Classification -  to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

The following steps have been made for Data Preparation to improve Prediction Accuracy:

1. Removing 2 observations with NA values for feature "Embarked"
2. Missing values for Age have been replaced by average Age in dependence to  'Passenger Class"
3. Distinct not just between male and female but also "children" for people with age under 18
4. Remove supposed irrelevant features like "PassengerID", "Passenger Name", "Cabin" and "Ticket"
